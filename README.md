The queries will work on LBD-triples that can be generated with [LD-BIM](https://ld-bim.web.app/).

For example:
* Open the [Duplex test example](https://ld-bim.web.app/?duplex=true) 
* Open Data Source Overview modal by clicking the red graph icon 
* Clicking the kebab menu at "data-source-0"
* Click download
